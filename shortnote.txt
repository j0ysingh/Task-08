This container runs a simple Flask web application. 
The Dockerfile defines how the app is packaged with Python and Flask installed. 
Once built, the image is pushed to Amazon ECR and deployed on ECS using Fargate. 
The load balancer distributes incoming traffic to the running container. 
Finally, users can access the app through the public DNS URL provided by the load balancer.
